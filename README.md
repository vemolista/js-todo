# js-todo
A simple project to refresh HTML and JS basics.

## Tech
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## How to run it
- Open [index.html](https://github.com/vemolista/js-todo/blob/50984cdd07777312a18224e72e2934a68201c9c8/index.html) in your browser of choice

## What it does
- HTML form handling
- JS to save form data in the browser's `localStorage`

## Notable
- Wouldn't it be wonderful if it all was just `<input type="something">` and not randomly `<textarea>` or `<select>`?
- You can do `<input type="submit">` (which is crazy?) but `<button type="submit">` is better 'cause you can stuff HTML into it
- `readonly` attribute will submit data, `disabled` will not
- placeholders are such an anti-pattern
- I don't like pure JS (TS ftw.)
- "semantic" CSS classes are so painful (Tailwind <3)
- [I think I'm a Locality of Behavior type of dude](https://deploy-preview-1650--htmx.netlify.app/essays/locality-of-behaviour/)
